The language of the modal $\mu$-calculus ($\MC$) on $\props$ is given by the following grammar:
%
\begin{equation*}
    \varphi\ ::= q \mid \neg q \mid \varphi \land \varphi \mid
    \varphi \lor \varphi \mid  \Diamond \varphi \mid \Box \varphi \mid
    \mu p.\varphi \mid \nu p.\varphi
\end{equation*}
% \begin{equation*}
%     \varphi\ ::= q \mid \varphi \land \varphi \mid \lnot\varphi
%     \mid  \Diamond \varphi \mid
%     \mu p.\varphi
% \end{equation*}
%
where $p,q \in \props$ and $p$ is positive in $\varphi$ (i.e., $p$ is not negated).
We use the standard convention that no variable is both free and bound in a formula and that every bound variable is fresh.
Sometimes we write $\psi \subf \varphi$ to denote that $\psi$ is a subformula of $\varphi$.

%
Let $p$ be a bound variable occuring in some formula $\varphi \in \MC$, we use $\delta_p$ to denote the binding definition of $p$, that is, the formula such that either $\mu p.\delta_p$ or $\nu p.\delta_p$ are subformulas of $\varphi$.

The semantics of this language is completely standard. Let $\model = \tup{T,R,\tscolors, s_I}$ be a transition system and $\varphi \in \MC$. We inductively define the \emph{meaning} $\ext{\varphi}^{\model}$ which includes the following clauses for the least $(\mu)$ and greatest ($\nu$) fixpoint operators:
%
\begin{align*}
  \ext{\mu p.\psi}^{\model}  & :=   \bigcap \{S \subseteq T \mid S \supseteq \ext{\psi}^{\model[p\mapsto S]} \}  \\
  \ext{\nu p.\psi}^{\model}  & :=   \bigcup \{S \subseteq T \mid S \subseteq \ext{\psi}^{\model[p\mapsto S]} \}
\end{align*}
%
We say that $\varphi$ is \emph{true} in $\model$ (notation $\model \mmodels \varphi$) iff $s_I \in \ext{\varphi}^{\model}$.% As for the case of $\wmso$, $\ext{\varphi}$ denotes the class of transition systems where $\varphi$ is true.\fcwarning{Pointed or not?}

We will now describe the semantics defined above in game-theoretic terms. That is,
we will define the evaluation game $\egame(\varphi,\model)$ associated with a formula $\varphi \in \MC$ and a transition system $\model$. This game is played by two players (\eloise and \abelard) moving through positions $(\xi,s)$ where $\xi \subf \varphi$ and $s \in T$.

In an arbitrary position $(\xi,s)$ it is useful to think of
\eloise trying to show that $\xi$ is true at $s$, and of \abelard of trying to convince her that $\xi$ is false at $s$. The rules of the evaluation game are given in Table~\ref{egame_mucalc}.
Every finite match of this game is lost by the player that got stuck. To give a winning condition for an infinite match let $p$ be, of the bound variables of $\varphi$ that get unravelled infinitely often, the one that is the highest in the syntactic tree of $\varphi$. The winner of the match is \abelard if $p$ is a $\mu$-variable and \eloise if $p$ is a $\nu$-variable. We say that $\varphi$ is true in $\model$ iff \eloise has a winning strategy in $\egame(\varphi,\model)$.

\begin{proposition}[Adequacy Theorem]\label{p:unfold=evalgame}
Let $\varphi = \varphi(p)$ be a formula of $\MC$ in which all occurrences of $p$ are positive, and let $(\model,s)$ be a pointed Kripke model. Then:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:adeq3}
s \in \mng{\mu p.\varphi}^{\model} %\iff s \in \Win_{\eloi}(\UG(\varphi_{x}^{\bbS}))
\iff (\mu p.\varphi,s) \in \win_{\eloise}(\egame(\mu p.\varphi,\model)).
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}

\bigskip
Formulas of the modal $\mu$-calculus are classified according to their
\emph{alternation depth}, which roughly is given as the maximal length of
a chain of nested alternating least and greatest fixpoint operators~\cite{Niwinski86}.
The \emph{alternation-free fragment} of the modal $\mu$-calculus~($\AFMC$) is usually defined as the collection of
$\MC$-formulas without nesting of least and greatest fixpoint operators. It can also be also given a more standard grammatical definition as follows.

Given a set $\qprops$ of propositional variables, we define the fragment of \MC \emph{noetherian} in $\qprops$, denoted by $\noe{\mu\ML}{\qprops}$,
by the following 
grammar:
\begin{equation*}
   \varphi ::= q
   \mid \psi
   \mid \varphi \lor \varphi
   \mid \varphi \land \varphi
     \mid \Diamond \varphi
       \mid \Box \varphi
   \mid \mu p.\phi'
\end{equation*}
where $q \in \qprops$, $\psi$ is a $\qprops$-free $\MC$-formula, and 
$\phi' \in \noe{\mu\ML}{\qprops\cup\{p\}}$. 
The \emph{co-noetherian} fragment $\conoe{\mu\ML}{Q}$ is defined dually.

\begin{definition}
The formulas of the \emph{alternation-free} $\mu$-calculus $\AFMC$ 
are defined by the following grammar:
\begin{equation*}
   \varphi ::= 
      q \mid \neg q 
   \mid \varphi\lor\varphi \mid \varphi\land\varphi 
      \mid \Diamond \varphi
       \mid \Box \varphi
   \mid \mu p. \varphi'    
   \mid \nu p. \varphi'',
\end{equation*} 
where 
$\phi' \in \AFMC \cap \noe{\mu\ML}{p}$
and dually $\phi'' \in \AFMC \cap \conoe{\mu\ML}{p}$.
\end{definition}

It is then immediate to verify that the above definition indeed captures exactly all formulas without alternation of least and greatest fixpoints.
\begin{fact}
  Let $\varphi$ be a formula of the modal $\mu$-calculus. $\varphi\in\AFMC$ iff for all subformulas $\mu p.\psi_1$ and $\nu q.\psi_2$ we have that $p$ is not free in $\psi_2$ and $q$ is not free in $\psi_1$.
\end{fact}
%The language $\mu_{D}\ML(\prop)$ can be stratified in the so called \emph{syntactic weak alternation hierarchy}.  More precisely, let $\Phi \subseteq \mu_{D}\ML(\prop)$.
%Then $\mu(\Phi)$ is the smallest class of formulae such that:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item $\Phi, \Phi^\delta \subset \mu(\Phi)$;
%\item If $\psi(p) \in \mu(\Phi)$,  $p$ is positive and free in $\psi$ and does not occurs in any subformula of $\psi$ of the form $\nu q. \varphi$, then $\mu p. \psi \in \mu(\Phi)$;
%\item If $\psi, \varphi \in \mu(\Phi)$, then $\psi \land \varphi, \psi \lor \varphi, \Diamond \psi, \Box \psi \in \mu(\Phi)$;
%%\item If $\psi, \varphi \in \eta(\Phi)$ and $x$ is bound in $\psi$, then $\varphi [ x / \psi] \in \eta(\Phi)$
%\end{itemize}
%The set $\nu(\Phi)$ is defined analogously. Hence, the classes $\Sigma^w_{n}$ and $\Pi^w_{n}$ are inductively defined by setting $\Sigma^w_{0}:=\Pi^w_{0}:=\ML$ and stating $\Sigma^w_{n+1}=\mu(\Pi^w_{n})$
%and $\Pi^w_{n+1}= \nu(\Sigma^w_{n})$, for $n\geq 0$.
%%$$\Delta^w_{n}:= \Sigma^w_{n} \cap \Pi^w_{n}$$
%%
%%The fixpoint alternation depth, $\ad$, of a formula is the number of non-trivial nestings of alternating least and greatest fixpoints. Formally,
%%the alternation depth of $\varphi \in \mathcal{L}_\mu$ is given by
%%\[
%%\ad(\varphi):=\inf\{k: \varphi \in \Delta^\mu_{k+1}\}.
%%\]
%It holds that $\mu_{D}\ML=\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\Sigma^w_{n}=\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\Pi^w_{n}$. 
%
%We therefore have to verify that $\Sigma^w_{n}, \Pi^w_{n}\subseteq \mu_{D}\ML(\prop)$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Assume the claim true for $n \in \mathbb{N}$. We verify $\Sigma^w_{n+1},\Pi^w_{n+1}\subseteq \mu_{D}\ML$. By definition $\Sigma^w_{n+1}=\mu(\Pi^w_{n})$. By induction hypothesis $\Pi^w_{n}\subseteq \mu_{D}\ML$. Let $\psi, \varphi \in \Sigma^w_{n+1} \cap \mu_{D}\ML$. Clearly $\psi^\delta, \psi \land \varphi, \psi \lor \varphi,\Diamond \psi, \Box \psi  \in \Sigma^w_{n+1} \cap \mu_{D}\ofoe$.
%Now, assume $p$ is positive and free in $\psi$ and does not occurs in any subformula of $\psi$ of the form $\nu q. \delta$. This means that $\psi(p) \in \conoe{\mu\ML}{p}$, and therefore we conclude that $\mu p.\psi(p) \in \mu_{D}\ML$. The case of $\Pi^w_{n+1}$ is treated analogously.


Over arbitrary transition systems, this fragment is
less expressive than the whole $\MC$~\cite{Park79}. %That is, there is a $\MC$-formula $\varphi$ such that $\ext{\varphi}$ is not $\AFMC$-definable~\cite{Park79}.

In order to properly define the fragment $\mucML \subseteq \AFMC$ which is of critical importance in this article, we are particularly interested in the \emph{continuous} fragment of the modal $\mu$-calculus. As observed in Section~\ref{sec:intro}, the abstract notion of continuity can be given a concrete interpretation in the context of $\mu$-calculus.
%
\begin{definition}
Let $\varphi \in \MC$, and $q$ be a propositional variable. We say that \emph{$\varphi$ is continuous in $q$} iff for every transition system $\model$ there exists some finite $S \subseteq_\omega \tsval(q)$ such that
$$
\model \mmodels \varphi \quad\text{iff}\quad \model[q \mapsto S] \mmodels \varphi .
$$
\end{definition}

We can give a syntactic characterisation of the fragment of $\MC$ that captures this property. Given a set $\qprops$ of propositional variables, we define the fragment of \MC \emph{continuous} in $\qprops$, denoted by $\cont{\MC}{\qprops}$, by induction in the following way
\begin{equation*}
   \varphi ::= q
   \mid \psi
   \mid \varphi \lor \varphi
   \mid \varphi \land \varphi
   \mid \Diamond \varphi
   \mid \mu p.\alpha
\end{equation*}
%
where $q \in \qprops$, $p \in \props \setminus \qprops$, $\alpha \in \cont{\MC}{\qprops\cup\{p\}}$, and $\psi$ is a $\qprops$-free $\MC$-formula. 

The  \emph{co-continuous} fragment $\cocont{\mu\ML}{Q}$ is defined dually. 

\begin{proposition}[\cite{Fontaine08,FV12}]\label{prop:FVcont}
A $\MC$-formula is continuous in $q$ iff it is equivalent to a formula in the fragment $\cont{\MC}{q}$.
\end{proposition}

Finally, we define $\mucML$ to be the fragment of $\MC$ where the use of the least fixed point operator is restricted to the continuous fragment. Formally, it is defined as follows.

\begin{definition}
Formulas of the fragment $\mucML$ are given by:% the following induction:
\begin{equation*}
   \varphi ::= q \mid \lnot q
    \mid \varphi \lor \varphi
        \mid \varphi \land \varphi
    \mid \Diamond \varphi
     \mid \Box \varphi \mid
    \mu p.\varphi' 
    \mid \nu p.\varphi''
    \end{equation*}
%
where $p,q \in \props$,  $\varphi' \in \cont{\MC}{p} \cap \mucML$, and dually $\varphi'' \in \cocont{\MC}{p} \cap \mucML$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
Let $\varphi \in \mucML$, the following hold
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\itemsep 0pt
\item $\varphi$ is an $\AFMC$-formula,
\item Every $\mu$-variable in $\varphi$ is existential (i.e., is only in the scope of diamonds), and dually every $\nu$-variable in $\varphi$ is universal (i.e., is only in the scope of boxes).
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Both points are proved by an easy induction on the complexity of a formula. For the first one,  it is enough to notice that if $\varphi \in \cont{\MC}{q} \cap \AFMC$, then $\mu q. \varphi \in \AFMC$ by definition of $\cont{\MC}{q} $.
\end{proof}

As an immediate consequence of Proposition \ref{prop:FVcont} we have the following:

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:cont}
For every $\mucML$-formula $\mu p. \varphi$, $\varphi$ is continuous in $p$.
\fznote{can we say also that $\nu p. \varphi$ is co-continuous in $p$, on the base of the second part of Prop. 2.14(2)?}
\end{corollary}


%\myparagraph{Finite approximants of monotone maps.}
%\index{approximant}
%\index{$F^\alpha$}
%Let $F:\wp(\moddom) \to \wp(\moddom)$ be a monotone map. The approximants of the least fixpoint of $F$ are the sets ${F^\alpha(\nada) \subseteq \moddom}$, where $\alpha$ is an ordinal. The map $F^\alpha$ is intuitively the $\alpha$-fold composition of $F$. Formally,% it is defined as
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\itemsep 0pt
%	\item $F^0(X) := \nada$,
%	\item $F^{\alpha+1}(X) := F(F^\alpha(X))$,
%	\item $F^\lambda(X) := \bigcup_{\alpha<\lambda} F^\alpha(X)$ for limit ordinals $\lambda$.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\noindent The sets $F^\alpha(\nada)$ are called approximants because of the following fact.
%
%\begin{fact}
%	For every $s\in\moddom$ we have that $s\in \lfp(F)$ if and only if $s\in F^\beta(\nada)$ for some ordinal $\beta$.
%\end{fact}
%
%Moreover, this approximation starts at $F^0(\nada) = \nada$ and grows strictly until it stabilizes for some ordinal $\beta$. This ordinal is called the closure or unfolding ordinal of $F$.
