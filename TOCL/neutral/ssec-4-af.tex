\subsection{From automata to fixpoint formulas and back}
   \label{sec:parity-to-mc}

In the context of modal fixpoint logics and automata operating on (possibly)
infinite objects, it is well-known that there are effective translations from 
parity automata to fixpoint formulas and vice versa~\cite{ALG02}.
The results on $\oslang$-automata that we need in this paper are the 
following.

\begin{theorem}\label{t:autofor}
There is an effective procedure that, given an automaton $\bbA$ in 
$\Aut(\oslang)$, returns a formula $\xi_{\bbA} \in \mu\oslang$ which satisfies
the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    
\item $\xi_{\bbA}$ is equivalent to $\bbA$;

\item $\xi_{\bbA} \in \mu_{N}\oslang$ if $\bbA \in \AutW(\oslang)$;

\item $\xi_{\bbA} \in \mu_{C}\oslang$ if $\bbA \in \AutWC(\oslang)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\label{t:fortoaut}
Let $\oslang$ be a on-step language that is closed under taking conjunctions and 
disjunctions.
Then there is an effective procedure that, given a formula $\xi \in \mu\oslang$
returns an automaton $\bbA_{\xi}$ in $\Aut(\oslang)$, which satisfies the 
following properties:
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item $\bbA_\xi$ is equivalent to $\xi$;
\item  $\bbA_\xi \in \AutW(\oslang)$ if $\xi \in \mu_{N}\oslang$;
\item  $\bbA_\xi \in \AutWC(\oslang)$ if $\xi \in \mu_{C}\oslang$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

For both theorems, the first item can be proved by standard methods. 
In order to prove the second and third items, some care is needed to ensure that
the translation obtained in the proof of the first item, lands in the right 
fragment of the language, respectively, produces an automaton of the right kind.
In both cases, these proofs are not entirely trivial, they are fairly 
straightforward, and certainly rather tedious. 
For this reason we refer the interested reader to the technical report for the
details.
