This section introduces and studies the parity automata that will be used in the characterisation of $\wmso$ and $\nmso$. The transition function of these automata will be defined by formulas of a so-called one-step language $\llang$. Subsection \ref{sec:parity-to-mc} illustrates one-step languages and give normal forms for relevant semantic properties such as monotonicity and continuity. We then have all the ingredients to formally introduce $\llang$-parity automata, in Subsection \ref{sec:parityaut}. The remaining part of the section is devoted to showing that classes of parity automata are equivalently described as modal fixpoint logics. After introducing the concept of a modal fixpoint logic parametric in $\llang$, in Subsection \ref{sec:onestep-to-mc}, we build an effective translation from $\llang$-parity automata, in Subsection~\ref{sec:parity-to-mc}.
